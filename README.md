# VirtualMemoryProject
Virtual Memory Simulator
This project implements a virtual memory management system in C. The simulator demonstrates the workings of a paged memory management system by implementing page tables, frame tables, page replacement algorithms (Clock Sweep and Approximate LRU), and handling page faults. The project includes memory access translation, tracking of dirty and referenced bits, and simulates memory accesses and page replacements.
